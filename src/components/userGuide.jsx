            someone you've never met left something 
            for you to listen to. like most things in life, you gotta give 
            something to get something. try pasting a link to a song you want
            to leave for the next person in the box above. once you're ready to
            exchange, go ahead and click the 'exchange' button. we'll give you
            something new to listen to.
